# Mock Sandbox

Use this folder to preview UI changes before touching the app code.

## How to run

```sh
npm run mockups
```

Open `http://localhost:5174/client-detail-mock.html` (or any other mock file).

## How to add a new mock

1. Copy an existing mock HTML/CSS file.
2. Keep the markup minimal and focused on layout + typography.
3. Link the CSS in the HTML and avoid any JS unless it is needed for layout.

## Notes

- These mock files are not wired to the app.
- Use them to validate layout and visual direction quickly.
